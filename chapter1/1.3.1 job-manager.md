Job Manager
---
The master processes, also known as Job Managers, coordinate and manage the execution of the program. Their main responsibilities include scheduling tasks, managing checkpoints, failure recovery, and so on.
(`master`进程，也叫`Job Managers`用于协调和管理程序的执行。他们的主要职责包括任务调度，管理`checkpoints`,失败恢复等待。)

There can be many Masters running in parallel and sharing these responsibilities. This helps in achieving high availability. One of the masters needs to be the leader. If the leader node goes down, the master node (standby) will be elected as leader.（可能会有多个Maters并行运行，共享这些职责。这有助于实现高可用。其中的一个master需要成为leader.如果leader节点down掉，那么standby 的`master`节点会被选为leader.）

The Job Manager consists of the following important components:
 `Job Manager `包含以下重要的组件：

Flink internally uses the Akka actor system for communication between the Job Managers and the Task Managers.（Flink 内部使用Akka actor系统来实现Job Managers 和Task Managers的通信。）
