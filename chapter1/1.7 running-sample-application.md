Running sample application
---
Flink binaries come with a sample application which can be used as it is. Let's start with a very simple application, word count. Here we are going try a streaming application which reads data from the netcat server on a specific port.
(Flink 的包里带着一个简单的程序，这个程序是可以用的。我们开始启动这个简单的应用程序`word count`。在这里，我们尝试一个`streaming`应用程序，这个程序从`metcat`服务的批定端口读数据。)
So let's get started. First start the netcat server on port 9000 by executing the following command:
（我们先启动`netcat`服务在端口9000）
```
nc -l 9999
```

Now the netcat server will be start listening on port 9000 so whatever you type on the command prompt will be sent to the Flink processing.
(现在`netcat`服务器已经启程并监听9000端口，所以你在命令提示符下敲的内容都会被发送到Flink 进程)
Next we need to start the Flink sample program to listen to the netcat server. The following is the command
接下来我们需要启动Flink的示例程序来监听`netcat`服务。命令如下:
```
bin/flink run examples/streaming/SocketTextstreamWordCount.iar --hostname localhost --port 9000
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Job execution switched to status RUNNING
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Source: Socket stream-> Flat Map(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Source: Socket stream -> Flat Map (1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Keyed Aggregation -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to SCHRDULED
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Keyed Aqqreqation -> Sink: Unnamed (1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Source: Socket stream-> Flat Map (1/1) switched to RUNNING
08/06/2016 10:32:40 Keyed Aggregation -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to RUNNING
```
This will start the Flink job execution. Now you can type something on the netcat console and Flink will process it
For example, type the following on the netcat server:
(这会启动`Flink job`的运行。现在我们可以在`netcat`控制台敲一些内容，Flink会处理它。比如：敲下面的内容在`netcat`控制台)
```

You can also checkout the Flink Web UI to see how your job is performing. The following screenshot shows the data flow plan for the execution:
你可以打开`Flink WEB UI`看一下你的job是如何 运行的。下面的截图显示了`data flow`执行计划。

Here for the job execution, Flink has two operators. The first is the source operator which reads data from the Socket stream. The second operator is the transformation operator which aggregates counts of words We can also look at the timeline of the job execution:
(这里job的执行，Flink 有两个操作（符）。第一个是`source`,这个从 `Socket stream`中读数据。第二个是`transformation`,它聚合单词数，我们也可以看一下job 执行的时间线。)
