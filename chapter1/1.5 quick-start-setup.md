Quick start setup
---
Now that we understand the details about Flink's architecture and its process model, it's time to get started with a quick setup and try out things on our own. Flink works on both . Windows and Linux machines
(截止目前，我们已经理解了Flink的架构和运行模型的相关细节，该安装并尝试做一些我们自己的事情了。Flink 可以同时工作在windows 和linux 平台上)
The very first thing we need to do is to download Flink's binaries. Flink can be downloaded from the Flink download page at: http://flink. apache.org/downloads.html(首先我们要做的是下载Flink的二进制包，见下面的地址)
On the download page, you will see multiple options as shown in the following screenshot:
（下载地址你可以看到更多象下边截图的选项）

In order to install Flink, you don't need to have Hadoop installed. But in case you need to connect to Hadoop using Flink then you need to download the exact binary that is compatible with the Hadoop version you have with you.（为了安装Flink,你不必安装Hadoop。但如果你需要用 Flink去链接Hadoop ，你需要下载确切的hadoop 兼容版本。）

As I have latest version of Hadoop 2.7.0 installed with me, I am going to download the Flink binary compatible with Hadoop 2.7.0 and built on Scala 2.11.Here is direct link to download http://www-us.apache.orq/dist/flink/flink-1.1.4/flink-1.1.4-bin-hadoop27-scal.a_2.11.tgz
（因为我已经安装了hadoop2.7.0版本，所以我下载了兼容hadoop 2.7.0 并构建在scala2.11上的Flink版本。下面是下载链接）
