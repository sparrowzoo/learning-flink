With distributed technologies evolving ([ɪ'vɒlvɪŋ])all the time, engineers are trying to push those technologies to their limits. Earlier, people were looking for faster, cheaper ways to process data. This need was satisfied when Hadoop was introduced. Everyone started using.Hadoop, started replacing their ETLs with Hadoop-bound ecosystem tools. Now that this need has been satisfied and Hadoop is used in production at so many companies, another need arose to process data in a streaming manner, which gave rise to technologies such as Apache Spark and Flink. Features, such as fast processing engines, the ability to scale in no time, and support for machine learning and graph technologies, are popularizing these technologies among the developer community
（随着分布式技术的持续发展，工程师们在尝试将这些技术推向极限。在这之前，人们寻求的是高性价比的方式去处理数据。这些伴随着`Hadoop`技术的面世将得到满足。几乎每个人都开始使用`Hadoop-bound`生态的工具替换他们的`ETLs`。现在这些需求都已经被满足并且`Hadoop`在很多公司被用于生产环境。另外，随着流处理需求的出现，催生了像`Apache Spark` 和`Flink`技术的出现，比如象快速处理引擎，在线扩展能力及机器学习和图技术，这些技术在开发者社区都非常受欢迎。）

Some of you might have been already using Apache Spark in your day-to-day life and might have been wondering if I have Spark why I need to use Flink? The question is quite expected and the comparison is natural. Let me try to answer that in brief. The very first thing we need to understand here is Flink is based on the streaming first principle which means it is real streaming processing engine and not a fast processing engine that collects streams as mini batches. Flink considers batch processing as a special case of streaming whereas it is vice-versa in the case of Spark. Likewise we will discover more such differences throughout this book 
（有些人在日常工作中可能已经使用了Apache Spark，可能也在考虑我已经使用了`Spark`,为什么还要用Flink？这个问题也是我意料之中的，并且这种比较也很正常。我用简要的方式试着回答一下这个问题。首先，我们需要理解Flink是基于流优先原则的,这意味着这是一个真正的流处理引擎，并且不是那种以搜集流作为mini 批处理的快速处理引擎。Flink 考虑将批处理作为一种特殊的流处理引擎。在这Spark里正好相反。同样的，我们将在本书中发现更多的差异）

this book is about one of the most promising technologies-Apache Flink. In this chapter we are going to talk about the following topics :
(本书是关于这个最有前途的技术(Apache Flink) 在这一节我们将继续讨论以下几个主题)

- History (历史)
- Architecture （架构）
- Distrubuted execution(分布式执行) 
- Features (特性)
- Quick start setup（快速开始）
- Cluster setup
- Running a sample application
