Distributed execution
---
Flink's distributed execution consists of two important processes, master and worker. When a Flink program is executed, various processes take part in the execution, namely Job Manager, Task Manager, and Job Client
(Flink的分布式运行包括两个重要的进程，master 和worker。当Flink 应用程序被执行时，很多进行会参与执行，它们分别是Job Manager,Task Manager 和Job Client)

The following diagram shows the Flink program execution:
(下面显示了Flink程序的执行过程)

The Flink program needs to be submitted to a job Client. The Job Client then submits the job to the Job Manager. It's the Job Manager's responsibility to orchestrate the resource allocation and job execution. The very first thing it does is allocate the required resources.Once the resource allocation is done, the task is submitted to the respective the Task Manager. On receiving the task, the Task Manager initiates a thread to start the execution.While the execution is in place, the Task Managers keep on reporting the change of states to the Job Manager. There can be various states such as starting the execution, in progress, or finished. Once the job execution is complete, the results are sent back to the client.(Flink 应用程序需要被提交给`Job Client`.`Job Client`紧接着会被提交给Job Manager.协调资源分配和job执行是 Job Manager的职责。首先，它需要分配Job所需的资源。一旦资源分配完成，那么任务会被提交给相应的Task Manager. Task Manager 收到任务就会启动一个线程开始执行。execution就位的同时，`Task Manager` 会持续上报Job Manager状态的变化。会有很多种状态，比如 `starting` `in progress` 及`finished`。一旦job 执行完成,结果将返回给客户端。)
