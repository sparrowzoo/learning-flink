SSH configurations

In order to set up the cluster, we first need to do password less connections to the TaskManager from the Job Manager machine. The following steps needs to be performed on the Job Manager machine which creates an SSH key and copies it to authorized_keys
(为了安装集群，我们首先需要`JobManager`到`TaskManager`之间的免密连接。下面的步骤需要在`Job Manager`上创建`SSH key`并`copy`至`authorized_keys`)
```
Ssh-keygen
```
This will generate the public and private keys in the /home/flinkuser/.ssh folder. Now copy the public key to the Task Manager machine and perform the following steps on the Task Manager to allow password less connection from the Job Manager(这个命令会生成公/私钥对在`/home/flinuser/.ssh`目录下。现在我们copy `public key`到`Task Manager`上，并在`Task Manager`上执行下面步骤允许`Job Manager`可以免密登录到`Task Manager`上)

```
sudo mkdir -p /home/flinkuser/.ssh
sudo touch /home/flinkuser/authorized_keys
sudo cp /home/flinkuser/.ssh  //error 译者注
sudo sh -c "cat id rsa.pub >> /home/flinkuser/.ssh/authorized keys". 
```
Make sure the keys have restricted access by executing the following commands
(执行下面的命令保证`key`的访问权限。)
```
sudo chmod 700 /home/flinkuser/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/flinkuser/.ssh/authorized keys
```
Now  you can test the password less SSH connection from the Job Manager machine

现在你可以从`Job Manager`上测试一下免密登录。
```
sudo ssh <task-manager-1> 
sudo ssh <task-manager-2> 
sudo ssh <task-manager-3>
```
If you are using any cloud service instances for the installations, please make sure that the ROOT login is enabled from SSH. In order to do this, you need to login to each machine: open file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.Then change the value to PermitRootLogin yes. Once you save the file, restart the SSH service by executing the command: 
(如果你用的是云服务安装，请确保`ROOT`用户的`SSH`是可用的。你需要登录到每台机器，然后打开`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`。改变`PermitRootLogin`的值为`yes`。保存后，重启ssh服务)
```
sudo service sshd restart
```
