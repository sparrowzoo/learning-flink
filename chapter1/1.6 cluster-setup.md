Cluster setup
---
Setting up a Flink cluster is very simple as well. Those who have a background of installing a Hadoop cluster will be able to relate to these steps very easily. In order to set up the cluster, let's assume we have four Linux machines with us, each having a moderate configuration. At least two cores and 4 GB RAM machines would be a good option to get started.The very first thing we need to do this is to choose the cluster design. As we have four machines, we will use one machine as the Job Manager and the other three machines as the Task Managers:
