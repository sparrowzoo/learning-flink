Flink started as a research project named Stratosphere with the goal of building a next generation big data analytics platform at universities in the Berlin area. It was accepted as an Apache Incubator project on April 16, 2014. Initial versions of Stratosphere were based on a research paper by Nephele at http://stratosphere.eu/assets/papers/Nephele_09.pdf.
(Flink 始于一个叫`Stratosphere`的科研型项目旨在柏林地区的大学里，构建下一代的大数据分析平台。它在2014.4.16被Apache 作为孵化项目接受。`Stratosphere `的初始版本是基于`Nephele`的研究论文。

The following diagram shows how the evolution of Stratosphere happened over time:
下图展示了`Stratosphere`发展历程：

The very first version of Stratosphere was focused on having a runtime, optimizer, and the Java API. Later, as the platform got more mature, it started supporting execution on various local environments as well as on YARN. From version 0.6, Stratosphere was renamed Flink.The latest versions of Flink are focused on supporting various features such as batch processing, stream processing, graph processing, machine learning, and so on 
（`Stratosphere `最初的版本专注在`runtime` `optimizer`和`Java API`,后来，随着平台越加成熟，开始支持在各种本地环境中运行 比如`YARN`。从0.6开始，`Stratosphere ` 被命名为`Flink`,`Flink`的最后版本专注于各种特性的支持，如batch processing,stream processing,graph processing,machine leaning 等等）

Flink 0.7 introduced the most important feature of Flink that is, Flink's streaming API Initially release only had the Java API. Later releases started supporting Scala API as well.Now let's look the current architecture of Flink in the next section.
(0.7版引入的最重要的功能是，Flink 的流API最始的发布版只有JAVA API.后来的发布版支持了scale API. 现在，我们看一下当前版本的架构)
