Actor system
---
An actor system is a container of actors with various roles. It provides services such as scheduling, configuration, logging, and so on. It also contains a thread pool from where all actors are initiated. All actors reside in a hierarchy. Each newly created actor would be assigned to a parent. Actors talk to each other using a messaging system. Each actor has its own mailbox from where it reads all the messages. If the actors are local, the messages are shared through shared memory but if the actors are remote then messages are passed thought RPC calls.
（`actor`系统包括很多角色。它提供象scheduling. configuration.logging 这样的服务。它包含一个线程池，所有的actor都在这里启动。所有的`actor`都驻留在这一层。所有新创建的`actor`都会被指定一个parent。`actors`彼此用消息系统 通信.每个actor 有它自己的`mailbox`,它从这个`mailbox`里读取消息。如果actors 是在本地，那么消息通过共享内存传递，如果它是在远程，则通过rpc传递。）

Each parent is responsible for the supervision of its children. If any error happens with the children, the parent gets notified. If an actor can solve its own problem then it can restart its children. If it cannot solve the problem then it can escalate the issue to its own parent.
(每个`parent`都负责监护它们的`actor`。如果任何一个`actor`出问题，那么`parent`将被通知。如果`actor`自己能解决问题那么它就重启`actor`.如果解决不了，则上报给`parent`)

In Flink, an actor is a container having state and behavior. An actor's thread sequentially keeps on processing the messages it will receive in its mailbox. The state and the behavior are determined by the message it has received.
(在Flink中，`actor`是一个含有状态和行为的容器。`actor`线程可以顺序地并持续地处理它从`mailbox`里收到的消息。这个状态和行为由它收到的消息确定。译者注：这里象netty的event Loop,线程自己会有一个队列(mailbox))
