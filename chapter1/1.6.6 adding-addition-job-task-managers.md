Adding additional Job/Task Managers
---
Flink provides you with the facility to add additional instances of Job and Task Managers to the running cluster.Before we start the daemon, please make sure that you have followed the steps given previously.To add an additional Job Manager to the existing cluster, execute the following command: sudo bin/jobmanager.sh start cluster Similarly, we need to execute the following command to add an additional Task Manager sudo bin/taskmanager.sh start cluster

(Flink提供在线增加`Job Manager`和`Task Manager`的功能。在我们启动daemon之前，你确认已经执行了上面我们提到那些步骤。加`Job Manager`到现有集群有如下命令
```
sudo bin/jobmanager.sh start cluster 
```
同样的，追加`Task Manager`执行下如下命令
```
sudo bin/taskmanager.sh  start cluster
```
